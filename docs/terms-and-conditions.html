          MYSTERY CHESTS, LOYALTY PROGRAMS & POINTS: All users who create and register a valid account to avail of the Services are eligible to join the partner
          loyalty program network and earn points and credits. Ark of Dreams may, at its sole and absolute discretion, award you points (“Points”), mystery
          chests or credits (“Credits”) on in-game currencies (“Arkon Crystals”) when you participate in a qualifying Promotion, which can be used to redeem
          Rewards (as defined below). Only certain qualifying Promotions are eligible to earn points and each Promotion may advise of a different earning or
          crediting procedures and has its own terms and conditions which you must read and comply with. Points have no inherent cash value but may be exchanged
          for services, cashback, or its equivalent through their network of merchants, affiliates, and partners. They can be purchased, resold or transferred,
          for value, under specific circumstances as agreed and acknowledged between you and Ark of Dreams partners. Points and credits may be regarded,
          construed, or used as exchangeable instruments under specific circumstances as agreed and acknowledged between you and Ark of Dreams partners. In the
          event, a reward, point, or credit exchange results in monetary fiscal gain for you (the “user”), you authorize Ark of Dreams and its partners to
          report such transactions for tax purpose as applicable to the appropriate tax revenue offices. In the event tax reporting does not include tax payment
          on behalf of the user, the user shall be responsible for the payment of the applicable taxes gained from the relevant transaction(s). As a member of
          the Ark of Dreams program, you will have access to the rewards which may be in the form of discounts, free gifts, promotion codes and other benefits
          as may be offered by Ark of Dreams and/or third party partner merchants as shown on the rewards catalogue that will be made available from time to
          time in the Services (“Rewards”). Ark of Dreams may, at its sole and absolute discretion, award you 1 Point or points of varying degrees subject to
          the applicable terms and conditions of the qualifying Promotion. For instance, if you complete a mission or achieve a milestone in your customer
          journey related to applicable Services, you can earn 1 point or be eligible to earn a reward as such X multiplier of your credits. Ark of Dreams may,
          at its sole and absolute discretion, determine and/or re-adjust the rate of the Points to be awarded for each qualifying Promotion, modify the
          eligibility and qualification of earning the Points, as may be notified to you from time to time. You shall be bound by the decision regarding Ark of
          Dreams ’s determination on any matters pertaining to the Loyalty Program Network, which shall be final and binding in all respects. You shall not be
          entitled to request from Ark of Dreams any explanation pertaining to the eligibility, qualifications, and calculation methods (for crediting or
          redemption of the Points) or other matters relating to the Points or discounts for whatsoever purposes. Where Ark of Dreams determines that you have
          committed fraud or abuse in earning points and/or redemptions may result in the forfeiture of your accumulated Points as well as cancellation and
          termination of your account. Points Earned At The Start, End, and During A Promotional Period Points, Credits, and Rewards may have an expiration date
          for redemption. There shall be no extension of time for the validity period of any unused Points, Credits, and Rewards. Ark of Dreams, in its sole and
          absolute discretion, shall have the right to manage any expired Points, Credits, and Rewards in such manner as it deems fit. You agree that you will
          have no claim whatsoever against Ark of Dreams for any expired Points, Credits, and Rewards. If you comply with the Terms of Use and have enough
          Points, you may select and redeem applicable Rewards which may be accessed through the Services or via SMS campaigns initiated by the Services. Your
          redemption of a Reward shall be subject to any additional terms and conditions of Ark of Dreams or the third party merchant (as the case may be) that
          offers the particular reward that you wish to redeem. Points that you have successfully redeemed for a Reward cannot be exchangeable for another
          Reward under any circumstances. No requests for exchange of Rewards will be entertained. Ark of Dreams may, at its sole and absolute discretion,
          reject your request to redeem Points for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation, where there are insufficient Points to redeem for the
          particular Reward. Ark of Dreams reserves the right, at its sole and absolute discretion, to change or withdraw any benefits or Rewards and/or
          terminate the Ark of Dreams Loyalty Program Network at any time, without prior notice to you. You shall be responsible for any taxes, levies or duties
          that arise in connection with the issuance of Points to you, your redemption of Points and/or the utilization of Rewards you have redeemed and all
          costs and expenses relating to the same shall be borne by you unless otherwise specified in writing by Ark of Dreams , its partners, and affiliates.
